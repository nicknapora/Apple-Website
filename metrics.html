		<h1>
			Metrics
		</h1>
		<p>
			This site assesses apple varieties by four categories, for each of which an apple is scored out of five points. The categories are as follows:
		</p>
		
		<div id="metrics">
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>
						Taste
					</th>
					<td>
						This assesses the flavor of the apple. Tartness and sweetness are both valued, as they are not mutually exclusive. Both traits are valued and generally make up the flavor profile of an apple variety. Unique contributors to flavor are noted and assessed as well.
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<th>
						Texture
					</th>
					<td>
						This assesses the mouthfeel of an apple variety. While difficult to put into words, most who have eaten apples have an intuitive understanding of what "mealiness" is. The texture of an apple can also be considered in terms of the "tightness" of its flesh; the structure of a mealy apple is more open and loose. For the purposes of this site, mealiness is a strictly negative trait, and apples are evaluated positively on the tightness of their structure.
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<th>
						Crispness
					</th>
					<td>
						Related to but distinct from texture, the crispness of an apple describes how resistive its structure is. An apple can have a tight structure that is soft, or it can have a mealy texture that is snappy when bitten. Crispness is evaluated as a positive trait on this site, though an excessively hard apple is of course undesirable.
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<th>
						Juiciness
					</th>
					<td>
						This describes the water content of an apple. While juiciness is generally positive, an apple can be overly juicy as well. This is an independent measurement from the other traits, but it is interconnected with all of them. 
					</td>
				</tr>
