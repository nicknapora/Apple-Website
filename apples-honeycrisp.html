		<h2>
			Taste: 4/5
		</h2>
		<p>
			The honeycrisp is at this point an iconic apple, accepted by many as default. As such, so too has its flavor become quintessential to the American apple palate. This cultural acceptance is well-founded: the honeycrisp is indeed a pleasing apple. One might even call the Honeycrisp inoffensive: neither cloyingly sweet nor off-puttingly tart, the Honeycrisp is adept at pleasing the average person. For this reason it is an ideal starter apple.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Texture 2/5
		</h2>

		<p>
			I simply do not tolerate mealiness in my apples, and the Honeycrisp specimen I picked out for review greatly disappointed in this regard. While not as bad as some Red or Yellow Delicious I have eaten in the past, it is unnerving for an apple that is held in such high regard to fall so flat.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Crispness 3/5
		</h2>

		<p>
			While the texture of the apple's flesh was disappointingly mealy, it surprisingly had some decent crispness. Mealy as it may be, this was not a soft apple, redeeming its mouthfeel somewhat. Below is a recording of a bite taken from the Honeycrisp apple.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Juiciness 3/5
		</h2>
		<p>
			Just as the Honeycrisp was surprisingly crisp, it was also surprisingly juicy. Indeed, when I burst out laughing at the ridiculousness of leaning into a high quality microphone to bite an apple, I showered my desk in a very unfortunate quantity of juice. This juiciness has no doubt contributed to the variety's popularity: the American apple-eating palate often values juiciness above texture.
