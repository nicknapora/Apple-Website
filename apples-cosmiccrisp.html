		<h1>
			Cosmic Crisp
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			The Cosmic Crisp is unique among the varieties sampled on this website for several reasons. First, it is remarkably new. Developed at Washington State University from 1997 to 2017, this variety, formally designated WA 38, is the first commercial apple variety created in the state. Largely a hybrid of the Enterprise and Honeycrisp, Cosmic Crisp aims to capture the typically pleasing texture and juiciness of the former while having the shelf life and durability of the former.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides the uniqueness of the variety itself, this review is unique from the others in that it required two samples. I happened to have two of the variety, as I have enjoyed it in the past, and the first that I sampled was much softer and mealier than I expected. While the second was still noticeably out of season, it was substantially improved in texture from the first.

		<h2>
			Taste: 3/5
		</h2>
		<p>
			Despite carrying only a faint reminder of the intense juiciness and acidity for which the variety is known, this specimen was passingly flavorful as an eating apple. Both of the samples were roughly equal in this regard, primarily differing in texture. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Texture 3/5
		</h2>

		<p>
			As noted above, the Cosmic Crisp did not live up to its pedigree. While not nearly as mealy as some of the weaker varieties I've sampled, it was more inconsistent; some bites of both specimens were mealier than others. The bites with the tightest flesh provided only brief reprieve from what was ultimately a disappointingly mediocre eating apple.

			Crispness 3/5

		<p>
			While the second sample offered significant improvement, neither specimen was especially firm. Despite this, an apple bred for raw eating will generally be snappier than other varieties. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Juiciness 3/5
		</h2>
		<p>
			While both samples were adequately juicy for an eating apple variety, I candidly expected more from the often-aggrandized Cosmic Crisp.
